## 3. Image Captioning

### Description
An AI application that generates captions for images by combining computer vision and natural language processing. This project uses a pre-trained VGG16 model for feature extraction and an RNN for generating captions.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV

### Features
- Extracts features from images
- Generates descriptive captions

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Prepare your dataset of images and captions.
3. Run the script using Python.

## 4. Recommendation System

### Description
A simple recommendation system that suggests items (like movies) to users based on their preferences using collaborative filtering techniques. This project demonstrates how to recommend items based on user ratings.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Surprise

### Features
- Collaborative filtering-based recommendations
- Easy to extend with more data

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the script using Python to see recommendations.

## 5. Face Detection and Recognition

### Description
An AI application that detects and recognizes faces in images or videos. This project employs Haar cascades for face detection and the `face_recognition` library for recognition capabilities.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- face_recognition

### Features
- Real-time face detection and recognition
- Simple interface using webcam or video files

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Prepare a directory named `known_faces` with images of known individuals.
3. Run the script using Python to start the application.
