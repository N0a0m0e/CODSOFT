## 3. Face Detection and Recognition

### Description
An AI application that detects and recognizes faces in images or videos. This project employs Haar cascades for face detection and the `face_recognition` library for recognition capabilities.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- face_recognition

### Features
- Real-time face detection and recognition
- Simple interface using webcam or video files

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Prepare a directory named `known_faces` with images of known individuals.
3. Run the script using Python to start the application.
